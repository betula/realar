Memory manager

Memory manager necessary for allocate, reallocate, and free memory block.

I can make simple memory manager

Block sizes:
  16 x i32
  16 * 2 = 32
  64
  128
  256
  512

  and etc.

  api: mem, x2, free

  step << 2

  16
  64
  256

  Struct of memory page
  [MEMORY_MGR] = first_struct [ // 8192 numbers // First 16 tech bytes, next 16 map of free blocks -> 8160
    [COUNT_FREE_16_BLOCKS] = 510
    [FIRST_FREE_16] = 32
    [NEXT_PAGE] = 0
    // 13 bytes free
    [16..32) free memory block map
  ]

  we need stack of free mem blocks. I think bit mask is best decision
  1 number -> 32 number cells.
