[] Make `for` of construction for set, map, arr

  for n of set
  for i, n of arr
  for k, n of map

  I need pass type of struct to struct, for using for after.
  I think its ok :+1:

[] Add log instruction

  log val, val, ..., "Message", "message", val, ..., *set_id, *map_id, *arr_id

  Of use printf analog

  log "Message: %i, %t, %t, %i", val, set_id, map_id, arr_size(map_id)
