[] Add remove box
[] Add link/unlink to unit2
[] Remove unit_1
[] Add `scope` functions to perf test after link/unlink will be added

```
let destroy_fn = scope(() => {
  let u = unit_1();
});
```

[] Fix both box bugs

[] Add React components view performance optimization
[] View performance test
    [] mobx-react
    [] redux+reselect

View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```
