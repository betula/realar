[] Add view2, test2, zone2
[] `changed` function babel compiler in expression section
[] Remove unit_1
[] Add `zone` functions to perf test after link/unlink will be added

```javascript
let destroy_fn = zone(() => {
  let u = unit_1();
  let s = service(unit_1);
});
```

[] Fix both box bugs (One from old perf test, second from todo in box code)

[] View performance test
    [] mobx-react

[] Add React components view performance optimization (optimization after test stand)


View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```

---
Add proc for each async functions

```javascript
const u = unit({
  async action() {
    // ...
  }
})

// Will be compiled to

const fn_action = async () => {
  fn_action.proc = (fn_action.proc || 0) + 1;
  // ...
  fn_action.proc --; // At the end
}
```

It will be perfect improvement before new async operations
