[] Rewrite unit builder

## Unit constructor build

```javascript
const u = unit({
  first_name: '',
  last_name: '',
  get name() {
    return this.first_name + ' ' = this.last_name;
  },
  set name(full_name) {
    [this.first_name, this.last_name] = full_name.split(' ');
  },
  construct() {},
  async sync() {
    await fetch('/');
  }
});
```

Should be compile to that

```javascript
const u = unit([function f() {
  let
    _u_box_id = box(),
    _first_name = '',
    _first_name_box_id = box(),
    _last_name = '',
    _name_computed_box_id = box();

  // Think about this. May be we need extend self obj

  return {
    [meta_unit]: [/* */],
    get first_name() {
      int_box_read(_first_name_box_id);
      return _first_name;
    },
    set first_name(v) {
      if (!Object.is(_first_name, v)) {
        _first_name = v
        int_box_change(_first_name_box_id);
      }
    },
    // ...
    get name() {
      int_computed_start(_name_computed_box_id);
      return [ // Each return section will be extended
        (this.first_name + ' ' = this.last_name),
        int_computed_finish(_name_computed_box_id)
      ][0];
    },
    set name(full_name) {
      const _no_tick = int_no_tick;
      if (_no_tick) int_tick_start();
      [this.first_name, this.last_name] = full_name.split(' ');
      if (_no_tick) int_tick_finish();
    },
    sync: async () => { // Bind this automatically
      /* */ int_store_context(_u_box_id);
      await fetch('/');
      /* */ int_load_context(_u_box_id); // After await
    }
  }
}, f[meta_unit_factory] = [/* */]][0]); // Add meta to unit f
```

Or

```javascript
const u = unit(function f(self) {
  // **

  Object.defineProperties(self, {
    first_name: {
      set: () => {} // Autobinding this
      get: () => {} // Autobinding this
    },
    // **
  });

  // **
  return self;
});

```

View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return [<JSX />, view_finish()][0]
}
```

[] Lightwight documentation. Simple and quick. Only for possibility to using. Because current crazy example so much difficult for any developers.

[] <Scope /> implementation. Its wrapper as Zone, but Scope dont create new zone, but create new scope. All services initilialized inside scope will be free then scope will unmount. Its needed for using service inside one component score for prevent passing one instance of unit by props to children components.

No.
I no need Scope or Scope child.
Because, I have only one case for using It.

For component how wants share one own unit instance to childrens. But create new instance of unit for another using of that component. Difficult case -> component inside same component.

I think in React for this using props. I need to stop think in this direction. Library interface is ok.

..

May be rename Zone to Scope.
Because when somebody hearing about zone, first association is zone.js.

May be Scope is better
And I can make two different type of scopes:

1. Totally isolated Scope - now its named as Zone
2. Scope is prototype mechanism, all top scope services are available, but new created only here.

<Scope></Scope>
<Scope child> // :+1:
</Scope>

It will be provide great possibilities! ...Hmmm... Examples of this please, I think Its no need.
