[] Add AssemblyScript impl, and see performance and bundle size difference
  I think that task not so long, because Map, Set and Array already exists in std. I need only make high performance code of box, and start, push, pop, its all.
  And after It I can see difference between AssemblyScript and u32

  I want spend little bit time with research performance of wasm compilers,
    because Its very interesting expert question.

[] Add C impl of box, and see performance and bundle size difference

[] JS Performance
  [] unit to unit2 -> see performance change (very interesting, init time too))
  [] play with "for of" construction

[] Add React components view performance optimization

View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```
