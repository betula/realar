[] Rewrite box to new compiler

[] Add global variables to u32

```
(global $name (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
(global.set $name (i32.const 1))
(global.get $name)
```

View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```
