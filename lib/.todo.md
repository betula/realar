[] First goal: same performance to mobx
[] Second goal: more performance to mobx

[] Take time for js impl performance optimization
  [] unit to unit2 -> see performance change (very interesting, init time too))
  [] play with "for of" construction

[] Add C impl of box, and see performance and bundle size difference
---

[] Add React components view performance optimization

View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```
