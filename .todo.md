[] Check ts types test

[] Update readme


[] Talk about unit
  Picture about sqare of component and logic inside. On the right, logic box outside of component.

[] First slide about Open Source
  Pic - two big word Open Source with my realar font family.

  Talk about big importance of Open Source
  We use tonns Open Source libruaries every day, but only few of us known as difficult to provide interesting ideas to people.

  Support my project by **star on github** It will be your first great contibution to Open Source field!


[] Example of using

```javascript
export const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const open = useCallback(() => setOpen(true), []);
  const close = useCallback(() => setOpen(false), []);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={open}>Open</button>
      <Dialog isOpen={isOpen} onClose={close} />
    </>
  )
}
```

```javascript
const AppLogic = unit({
  isOpen: false,
  open: () => this.isOpen = true,
  close: () => this.isOpen = false
});

export const App = () => {
  const { isOpen, open, close } = useUnit(AppLogic);
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={open}>Open</button>
      <Dialog isOpen={isOpen} onClose={close} />
    </>
  )
}
```

On the next slide we cut react view equal code, and see only difference.
[Next slide here]

Next slide about unit structure (service is the next theme)

```javascript
const Unit = unit({
  // service declarations
  // another unit declaraions
  // plain javascript values (initial values)

  // computed property (selector) declarations

  // method declarations

  // LifeCycle method declaraions
  //   constructor
  //   destructor
  //   expressions

  // cross unit communcation declarations
  //   event
  //   signal (will rename to shared)
  //   call
});
```

For a first talk only about simple sections

```javascript
// const Unit = unit({
//   todos: [],

//   get completed() {
//     return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
//   },

//   add(title) {
//     this.todos = [ ...this.todos, {
//       completed: false,
//       title,
//     }]
//   },
//   complete(todo) {
//     this.todos = this.todos.map(item =>
//       item === todo ? { ...todo, completed: true } : item
//     );
//   }
// })
```

Or may be short version is better

```javascript
const Unit = unit({
  todos: [],
  get completed() {
    return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
  },
  add(title, completed) {
    this.todos = [ ...this.todos, { title, completed }]
  }
})
```

Values: Each value of unit can be any javascript type other than function. Because function is a method. Can be reading and writing (assigning).

Selectors:

Methods:

[] Next slide unit life cycle:

constructor
destructor
expression

[] Next slide about expression section

[] Next slide about unit combination

[] Next slide about service

[] Next slide about event, signal, call

[] Next slide about Scope

[] I can make quick interface fix only in index file. And change dependent projects, examples, and tests. Renaming inside code I will make early.

On the next slice I need find way for imagine reusing state of logic. (May be stateless/statefull equals to unit/service).
[] Here should be wrote example about service. CurrentUser is the best example for middle level. (try It because I cant find another them)

```javascript
const CurrentUserService = unit()
```


But it's very difficult for starter people. Where we can use a service in UI task.
Service is logic (space) between units, between components. It's possibility for sharing state with or without logic between scratted components.

```javascript

// Like ????
const GlobalCounter = unit({
  val: 0,
  inc: () => this.val += 1,
  dec: () => this.val -= 1
});

export const App = () => {
  const { val, inc, dec } = useService(GlobalCounter);
  return (
//
  )
}
/// O noooo.. May be see example from crazy usage
```

[] Make starter as in google firebase function. Step by step. With instruction for installation! Its will be super perfect!!

[] Write contribution section to readme. Can contribute anybody and as your wish.

[] Site examples:
  https://atomicojs.github.io/doc

[] Make "effect" function for working only inside constructors.
```javascript
constructor() {
  effect(() => subscribeToExternalAndReturnUnsubscriber());
}
```

---

[] Lightwight documentation.
  Simple and quick.
  Only for possibility to using.
  Because current crazy example so much difficult for any developers.

    [] Add "Migrate mind from Mobx" section
      see on that mobx example https://codesandbox.io/s/mobx-react-n4kin

```javascript
constructor() {
  this.load.throttle(); // What about cancelling
  this.load.debounce(300); // Cancel on destruction

  // I want make not all operations:
  // 1. Each call will be cancel previous. And previous promise will be resolved with new value.
  // 2. Independent
},
async load() {
  //
  stoppable()
  abortable()
  cancellable()
  //

  const { cancelled, signal } = cancellable(); // Think...
  // ...

  await fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal });

  if (cancelled()) { // Babel parsed, its possible to use inside async promise then function
    break;
  }
}
```

---
High level bug:

```javascript
async load() {
  await delay(1);
  this.user = UserUnit(); // Here in constructor service resolving will be broken
}
```

Think about It. I can type about It and give decision:
```javascript
addUser() { // And restore zone for each function context for fix async operations
  this.user = UserUnit();
},
async load() {
  await delay(1);
  this.addUser();
}
```

And I can write babel plugin for restore context after each await operation

High Priorty!

[] Cancelling all core function calls after unit unlinked
[] I need wrap only JSX return functions ...
    `view_skip_first_deep` has errors if no have JSX inside test body, only inside another funcs

---
[] Make boilerplate project
[] Make first production project

---
[] Think about possibility to listen redux actions. Research it.

---
[] Make unit function `unit.combine`

```javascript
let u1 = unit({
  a: 11,
  b() {}
});

let u2 = unit({
  a: 12,
  m() {}
});

let u_ = unit.combine(u1, u2); // { a: 12, b() {}, m() {} }
```

[] For accessing to parent method in override func
  your can use `super` keyword for call overrided function. (Optional)

```javascript
let u2 = unit({
  b() {
    super();
  }
});

let u_ = unit.combine(u1, u2);
```
