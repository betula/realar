[] Lightwight documentation.
  Simple and quick.
  Only for possibility to using.
  Because current crazy example so much difficult for any developers.

[] Make boilerplate project
[] Make first production project

---
[] Make unit function `unit.combine`

```javascript
let u1 = unit({
  a: 11,
  b() {}
});

let u2 = unit({
  a: 12,
  m() {}
});

let u_ = unit.combine(u1, u2); // { a: 12, b() {}, m() {} }
```

[] For accessing to parent method in override func
  your can use `super` keyword for call overrided function.

```javascript
let u2 = unit({
  b() {
    super();
  }
});

let u_ = unit.combine(u1, u2);
```

---
[] View build, decrease callback nesting for performace reason I think

```javascript
function App() {
  return <JSX />
}
```

Compile to

```javascript
function App() {
  view_start(); // Possible to only start, but better finish it here
  return _ret = <JSX />, view_finish(), _ret;
}
```

---
[] Add proc for each async functions

```javascript
const u = unit({
  async action() {
    // ...
  }
})

// Will be compiled to

const fn_action = async () => {
  fn_action.proc = (fn_action.proc || 0) + 1;
  // ...
  fn_action.proc --; // At the end
}
```

It will be perfect improvement before new async operations

[] Effector style usage example
[] Recoil style usage example
[] React+redux view performance test

[] Modern async operations

[] Fix both box bugs
  (One from old perf test, second from todo comment in core box code)

[] View performance test
    [] mobx-react

[] Add React components view performance optimization
  (optimization after test stand)
